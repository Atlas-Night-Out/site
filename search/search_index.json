The Diabetic way was first created in 2000 A little about me I have had diabetes for over 50 years now, and during this time I have built up a lot of information and knowledge to hopefully help other diabetics to a healthier T1 living by means of exercise and on wearing or having a CGM and pump or Pod with better foods to control are Blood ranges better, for a healthier future. It's a very difficult and hard disease to cope with let alone deal with other issues in life it's a very hard battle to deal and go through with and for someone to just get the disease can be a nightmare to understanding it all so quickly! There is lots of information now on the internet, but this information can also be very confusing due to things changing that\u2019s very fast, and information not keeping up with documents for people to know what\u2019s best and latest information for Diabetics to know what Past is and what is the Future to read! Hopefully these Docs will get dated so you will know! I have been on computers since the Zx81 when it was just a black and white screen no sound and know way back then that this could be some fun trying to get it to help me with my diabetes. this was in the 1970's now in 2021 I see that computers are doing a lot more in helping Diabetics live and manage a easier life and want in some way also try to help where I can in doing so. I will not be teaching you on this site of Diabetes itself you will be better visiting My favorite Diabetes web site Diabetes.uk I will also always be relating to a Type 1 Diabetes not a Type 2 has I do not have this disease myself and would find it hard to relate to it like I do with type 1! I will I will be also looking at new ways to try to add foods and recipes and to my web site which I invented in Jan 2021 and hope the rest of the diabetes communities take on this new way to their web sites too, a quick scan on the screen is very helpful tool with myfitnesspal, and I will also be trying to add events that Blackburn C.T.C also known as (We are Cycling UK) take me on and hope many more Type ones join me on the rides and I will be sharing the routes for you to join us if you wish to do so! as I am not a leader in cycling and only do it to better control my difficult Diabetes with issues I have with it and controlling it. I just started the site to learn how to make a web site in the first place and by me learning this I\u2019m now trying to help with new information and programmes that come to are needs and in us having to learn the development of Diabetes getting better with technologies being adapted into are everyday use. I hope you enjoy the Docs and cycling events but more important is for yourself to get out on a bike (not Car) to help your Diabetes as it won\u2019t help you sitting doing nothing and pumping loads of insulin into you, but more important is you enjoy in doing so. Xdrip and Nightscout are extremely hard to get setup at the start but once you are setup you will not looking back! It\u2019s the way forward! I'm also now able to create websites is one big battle I've overcome with grammar issues, so all I need to overcome now is my English literature as I'm a terrible writer and grammar too! So, if there is anyone who can kindle spare time and would enjoy doing designs and writing on the site please gets in touch with me! Will greatly help me trying to do it correctly! I want to focus on the future of diabetes and help in guiding people into the new world of CGM and Pumps and also Pods.

Nightscout Plugins Plugins Plugins are used extend the way information is displayed, how notifications are sent, alarms are triggered, and more. The built-in/example plugins that are available by default are listed below. The plugins may still need to be enabled by adding to the ENABLE environment variable. Default Plugins These can be disabled by adding them to the DISABLE variable, for example DISABLE=\"direction upbat\" delta (BG Delta) Calculates and displays the change between the last 2 BG values. direction (BG Direction) Displays the trend direction. upbat (Uploader Battery) Displays the most recent battery status from the uploader phone. . Use these extended setting to adjust behavior: UPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable uploader battery alarms via Pushover and IFTTT. UPBAT_WARN (30) - Minimum battery percent to trigger warning. UPBAT_URGENT (20) - Minimum battery percent to trigger urgent alarm. timeago (Time Ago) Displays the time since last CGM entry. Use these extended setting to adjust behavior: TIMEAGO_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable stale data alarms via Pushover and IFTTT. ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN (on) - possible values on or off ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN_MINS (15) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a warning ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT (on) - possible values on or off ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT_MINS (30) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a urgent alarm devicestatus (Device Status) Used by upbat and other plugins to display device status info. Supports the DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED=\"true\" extended setting to send all device statuses to the client for retrospective use and to support other plugins. errorcodes (CGM Error Codes) Generates alarms for CGM codes 9 (hourglass) and 10 (???). Use extended settings to adjust what errorcodes trigger notifications and alarms: ERRORCODES_INFO (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8) - By default the needs calibration (blood drop) and other codes below 9 generate an info level notification, set to a space separate list of number or off to disable ERRORCODES_WARN (off) - By default there are no warning configured, set to a space separate list of numbers or off to disable ERRORCODES_URGENT (9 10) - By default the hourglass and ??? generate an urgent alarm, set to a space separate list of numbers or off to disable ar2 (AR2 Forecasting) Generates alarms based on forecasted values. See Forecasting using AR2 algorithm Enabled by default if no thresholds are set OR ALARM_TYPES includes predict. Use extended settings to adjust AR2 behavior: AR2_CONE_FACTOR (2) - to adjust size of cone, use 0 for a single line. simplealarms (Simple BG Alarms) Uses BG_HIGH, BG_TARGET_TOP, BG_TARGET_BOTTOM, BG_LOW thresholds to generate alarms. Enabled by default if 1 of these thresholds is set OR ALARM_TYPES includes simple. profile (Treatment Profile) Add link to Profile Editor and allow to enter treatment profile settings. Also uses the extended setting: PROFILE_HISTORY (off) - possible values on or off. Enable/disable NS ability to keep history of your profiles (still experimental) PROFILE_MULTIPLE (off) - possible values on or off. Enable/disable NS ability to handle and switch between multiple treatment profiles Advanced Plugins: careportal (Careportal) An optional form to enter treatments. boluscalc (Bolus Wizard) food (Custom Foods) An option plugin to enable adding foods from database in Bolus Wizard and enable . rawbg (Raw BG) Calculates BG using sensor and calibration records from and displays an alternate BG values and noise levels. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting DISPLAY (unsmoothed) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record. unfiltered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value. filtered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high. unsmoothed - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the filtered setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the unfiltered setting) by the ratio. The effect is to exagerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm. iob (Insulin-on-Board) Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with insulin doses and the dia and sens fields from the treatment profile. cob (Carbs-on-Board) Adds the COB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with carb doses and the carbs_hr, carbratio, and sens fields from the treatment profile. bwp (Bolus Wizard Preview) This plugin in intended for the purpose of automatically snoozing alarms when the CGM indicates high blood sugar but there is also insulin on board (IOB) and secondly, alerting to user that it might be beneficial to measure the blood sugar using a glucometer and dosing insulin as calculated by the pump or instructed by trained medicare professionals. The values provided by the plugin are provided as a reference based on CGM data and insulin sensitivity you have configured, and are not intended to be used as a reference for bolus calculation. The plugin calculates the bolus amount when above your target, generates alarms when you should consider checking and bolusing, and snoozes alarms when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG. Uses the results of the iob plugin and sens, target_high, and target_low fields from the treatment profile. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting BWP_WARN (0.50) - If BWP is > BWP_WARN a warning alarm will be triggered. BWP_URGENT (1.00) - If BWP is > BWP_URGENT an urgent alarm will be triggered. BWP_SNOOZE_MINS (10) - minutes to snooze when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG. BWP_SNOOZE - (0.10) If BG is higher then the target_high and BWP < BWP_SNOOZE alarms will be snoozed for BWP_SNOOZE_MINS. cage (Cannula Age) Calculates the number of hours since the last Site Change treatment that was recorded. CAGE_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable notifications to remind you of upcoming cannula change. CAGE_INFO (44) - If time since last Site Change matches CAGE_INFO, user will be warned of upcoming cannula change CAGE_WARN (48) - If time since last Site Change matches CAGE_WARN, user will be alarmed to to change the cannula CAGE_URGENT (72) - If time since last Site Change matches CAGE_URGENT, user will be issued a persistent warning of overdue change.

When enabled, speaks out the blood glucose values, IOB and alarms. Note you have to set the LANGUAGE setting on the server to get all translated alarms. cors (CORS) Enabled CORS so other websites can make request to your Nightscout site, uses these extended settings: CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN (*) - The list of sites that are allow to make requests dbsize (Database Size) Show size of Nightscout Database, as a percentage of declared available space or in MiB. Many deployments of Nightscout use free tier of MongoDB Atlas on Heroku, which is limited in size. After some time, as volume of stored data grows, it may happen that this limit is reached and system is unable to store new data. This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit. IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration. NOTE: This plugin rely on db.stats() for reporting logical size of database, which may be different than physical size of database on server. It may work for free tier of MongoDB on Atlas, since it calculate quota according to logical size too, but may fail for other hostings or self-hosted database with quota based on physical size. NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only. It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases. In such case, spliting known quota equally beetween databases and setting DBSIZE_MAX to that fraction may help, but wont be precise. All sizes are expressed as integers, in Mebibytes 1 MiB == 1024 KiB == 1024*1024 B DBSIZE_MAX (496) - Maximal allowed size of database on your mongoDB server, in MiB. You need to adjust that value to match your database hosting limits - default value is for standard Heroku mongoDB free tier. DBSIZE_WARN_PERCENTAGE (60) - Threshold to show first warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size - pill will show size in yellow. DBSIZE_URGENT_PERCENTAGE (75) - Threshold to show urgent warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size, it is urgent to do backup and clean up old data. At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB (false) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. This plugin should be enabled by default, if needed can be diasabled by adding dbsize to the list of disabled plugins, for example: DISABLE=\"dbsize\". Extended Settings Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables. These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a _. For example setting MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234 would make extendedSettings.exampleValue available to the MYPLUGIN plugin. Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser. DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED (true) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site. DEVICESTATUS_DAYS (1) - Defaults to 1, can optionally be set to 2. Users can use this to show 48 hours of device status data for in retro mode, rather than the default 24 hours. Setting this value to 2 will roughly double the bandwidth usage of nightscout, so users with a data cap may not want to update this setting. Pushover In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for Pushover based alarms and notifications. To get started install the Pushover application on your iOS or Android device and create an account. Using that account login to Pushover, in the top left you\u2019ll see your User Key, you\u2019ll need this plus an application API Token/Key to complete this setup. You\u2019ll need to Create a Pushover Application. You only need to set the Application name, you can ignore all the other settings, but setting an Icon is a nice touch. Maybe you'd like to use this one? Pushover is configured using the following Environment Variables: ENABLE - pushover should be added to the list of plugin, for example: ENABLE=\"pushover\" . PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN - Used to enable pushover notifications, this token is specific to the application you create from in Pushover , additional pushover information below. PUSHOVER_USER_KEY - Your Pushover user key, can be found in the top left of the Pushover site, this can also be a pushover delivery group key to send to a group rather than just a single user. This also supports a space delimited list of keys. To disable INFO level pushes set this to off . PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide alarms (level > WARN ). If not defined this will fallback to PUSHOVER_USER_KEY . A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to a CWD that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Alarm pushes set this to off . PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to PUSHOVER_USER_KEY or PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY . This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Announcement pushes set this to off . BASE_URL - Used for pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site, use https when possible. API_SECRET - Used for signing the pushover callback request for acknowledgments. If you never want to get info level notifications (treatments) use PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=\"off\" If you never want to get an alarm via pushover use PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY=\"off\" If you never want to get an announcement via pushover use PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY=\"off\" If only PUSHOVER_USER_KEY is set it will be used for all info notifications, alarms, and announcements For testing/development try localtunnel . IFTTT Maker In addition to the normal web based alarms, and pushover, there is also integration for IFTTT Webhooks. With Maker you are able to integrate with all the other IFTTT Services. For example you can send a tweet when there is an alarm, change the color of hue light, send an email, send and sms, and so much more. Setup IFTTT account: login or create an account Follow the Detailed IFTTT setup Instructions Configure Nightscout by setting these webpage environment variables: ENABLE - maker should be added to the list of plugins, for example: ENABLE=\"maker\". MAKER_KEY - Set this to your secret key (see [Detailed Instructions ) MAKER_KEY=\"abcMyExampleabc123defjt1DeNSiftttmak-XQb69p\" This also supports a space delimited list of keys. MAKER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Maker key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to MAKER_KEY. A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with ns-. The core events are: ns-event - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications. This is good catch all event for general logging. ns-allclear - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms. For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green. ns-info - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-warning - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-urgent - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. see the full list of events Treatment Profile Some of the plugins make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor, see the link in the Settings drawer on your site.

Enable/disable NS ability to handle and switch between multiple treatment profiles Advanced Plugins: careportal (Careportal) An optional form to enter treatments. boluscalc (Bolus Wizard) food (Custom Foods) An option plugin to enable adding foods from database in Bolus Wizard and enable . rawbg (Raw BG) Calculates BG using sensor and calibration records from and displays an alternate BG values and noise levels. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting DISPLAY (unsmoothed) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record. unfiltered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value. filtered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high. unsmoothed - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the filtered setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the unfiltered setting) by the ratio. The effect is to exagerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm. iob (Insulin-on-Board) Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with insulin doses and the dia and sens fields from the treatment profile. cob (Carbs-on-Board) Adds the COB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with carb doses and the carbs_hr, carbratio, and sens fields from the treatment profile. bwp (Bolus Wizard Preview) This plugin in intended for the purpose of automatically snoozing alarms when the CGM indicates high blood sugar but there is also insulin on board (IOB) and secondly, alerting to user that it might be beneficial to measure the blood sugar using a glucometer and dosing insulin as calculated by the pump or instructed by trained medicare professionals. The values provided by the plugin are provided as a reference based on CGM data and insulin sensitivity you have configured, and are not intended to be used as a reference for bolus calculation. The plugin calculates the bolus amount when above your target, generates alarms when you should consider checking and bolusing, and snoozes alarms when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG. Uses the results of the iob plugin and sens, target_high, and target_low fields from the treatment profile. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting BWP_WARN (0.50) - If BWP is > BWP_WARN a warning alarm will be triggered. BWP_URGENT (1.00) - If BWP is > BWP_URGENT an urgent alarm will be triggered. BWP_SNOOZE_MINS (10) - minutes to snooze when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG.

Many deployments of Nightscout use free tier of MongoDB Atlas on Heroku, which is limited in size. After some time, as volume of stored data grows, it may happen that this limit is reached and system is unable to store new data. This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit. IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration. NOTE: This plugin rely on db.stats() for reporting logical size of database, which may be different than physical size of database on server. It may work for free tier of MongoDB on Atlas, since it calculate quota according to logical size too, but may fail for other hostings or self-hosted database with quota based on physical size. NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only. It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases. In such case, spliting known quota equally beetween databases and setting DBSIZE_MAX to that fraction may help, but wont be precise. All sizes are expressed as integers, in Mebibytes 1 MiB == 1024 KiB == 1024*1024 B DBSIZE_MAX (496) - Maximal allowed size of database on your mongoDB server, in MiB. You need to adjust that value to match your database hosting limits - default value is for standard Heroku mongoDB free tier. DBSIZE_WARN_PERCENTAGE (60) - Threshold to show first warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size - pill will show size in yellow. DBSIZE_URGENT_PERCENTAGE (75) - Threshold to show urgent warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size, it is urgent to do backup and clean up old data. At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB (false) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. This plugin should be enabled by default, if needed can be diasabled by adding dbsize to the list of disabled plugins, for example: DISABLE=\"dbsize\". Extended Settings Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables. These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a _. For example setting MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234 would make extendedSettings.exampleValue available to the MYPLUGIN plugin. Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser. DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED (true) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site. DEVICESTATUS_DAYS (1) - Defaults to 1, can optionally be set to 2. Users can use this to show 48 hours of device status data for in retro mode, rather than the default 24 hours. Setting this value to 2 will roughly double the bandwidth usage of nightscout, so users with a data cap may not want to update this setting. Pushover In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for Pushover based alarms and notifications. To get started install the Pushover application on your iOS or Android device and create an account. Using that account login to Pushover, in the top left you\u2019ll see your User Key, you\u2019ll need this plus an application API Token/Key to complete this setup. You\u2019ll need to Create a Pushover Application. You only need to set the Application name, you can ignore all the other settings, but setting an Icon is a nice touch. Maybe you'd like to use this one? Pushover is configured using the following Environment Variables: ENABLE - pushover should be added to the list of plugin, for example: ENABLE=\"pushover\" . PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN - Used to enable pushover notifications, this token is specific to the application you create from in Pushover , additional pushover information below. PUSHOVER_USER_KEY - Your Pushover user key, can be found in the top left of the Pushover site, this can also be a pushover delivery group key to send to a group rather than just a single user. This also supports a space delimited list of keys. To disable INFO level pushes set this to off . PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide alarms (level > WARN ). If not defined this will fallback to PUSHOVER_USER_KEY . A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to a CWD that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Alarm pushes set this to off . PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to PUSHOVER_USER_KEY or PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY . This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Announcement pushes set this to off . BASE_URL - Used for pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site, use https when possible. API_SECRET - Used for signing the pushover callback request for acknowledgments. If you never want to get info level notifications (treatments) use PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=\"off\" If you never want to get an alarm via pushover use PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY=\"off\" If you never want to get an announcement via pushover use PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY=\"off\" If only PUSHOVER_USER_KEY is set it will be used for all info notifications, alarms, and announcements For testing/development try localtunnel . IFTTT Maker In addition to the normal web based alarms, and pushover, there is also integration for IFTTT Webhooks. With Maker you are able to integrate with all the other IFTTT Services. For example you can send a tweet when there is an alarm, change the color of hue light, send an email, send and sms, and so much more. Setup IFTTT account: login or create an account Follow the Detailed IFTTT setup Instructions Configure Nightscout by setting these webpage environment variables: ENABLE - maker should be added to the list of plugins, for example: ENABLE=\"maker\". MAKER_KEY - Set this to your secret key (see [Detailed Instructions ) MAKER_KEY=\"abcMyExampleabc123defjt1DeNSiftttmak-XQb69p\" This also supports a space delimited list of keys. MAKER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Maker key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to MAKER_KEY. A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with ns-. The core events are: ns-event - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications. This is good catch all event for general logging. ns-allclear - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms. For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green. ns-info - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-warning - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-urgent - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. see the full list of events Treatment Profile Some of the plugins make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor, see the link in the Settings drawer on your site. Treatment Profile Fields: timezone (Time Zone) - time zone local to the patient. Should be set. units (Profile Units) - blood glucose units used in the profile, either \"mg/dl\" or \"mmol\" dia (Insulin duration) - value should be the duration of insulin action to use in calculating how much insulin is left active. Defaults to 3 hours. carbs_hr (Carbs per Hour) - The number of carbs that are processed per hour, for more information see #DIYPS. carbratio (Carb Ratio) - grams per unit of insulin. sens (Insulin sensitivity) How much one unit of insulin will normally lower blood glucose. basal The basal rate set on the pump. target_high - Upper target for correction boluses. target_low - Lower target for correction boluses. Some example profiles are here.","title":"Nightscout Plugins  "},{"location":"user-guide/Nightscout_update/","text":"Welcome to The Diabetic way For full Website content visit The Diabetic Way .
